Future Implementation Ideas
•   Login Page
    o   Further development of the database and connection to the app.
           Users table
•   Home page
    o   Connect welcome message to the database
    o   Connect to schedule table in database.
           Display the classes and times that user has during that day
           Connect to other events, clubs, or teams that the student is a part of
    o   Connect interest table in database
           Display interests as buttons 
    o   Add a place to scan qr codes
•   Athletics Page
    o   Link to whatever ticket services the school decides to use for that year
    o   Display the upcoming sporting events and intramurals
•   Student Events
    o   Add upcoming user events that are dynamic and change as the day changes
    o   Create an activity board, guest speaker and theme night pages
           These pages can be basic, but should be easy to update and allow for people to see information regarding events time, date, and how to register for the events
    o   Possibly add things such as performances on campus.
•   News
    o   Add url for all of the sbutv buttons
•   Student Resources
    o   Fix issues with non linking buttons not activating on press
    o   Modify the buttons so they take up the full screen rather than just the top
•   Profile
    o   Work with safety and security to develop a qr code that can be scanned and used as a student ID
           Add a popup that when the Student ID button is pressed. The qr code is displayed.
    o   Figure out how to make light and dark mode work
    o   Allow for the user to actually change their user profile
           Find a way to add a profile picture
    o   Modify the buttons so they take up the full screen rather than just the top
•   Database
    o   Add student ID to users table
    o   Add table to store users schedule
           Input via the school for each user
           Link to student via student ID
    o   Add table to store users interests
           Ability to input into database table when added to app.
           When interest is removed, remove it from the table
           Link to each student via student ID
    o   Add table to store if a student is in a club or event
           Possibly just incorporate this to the users interest
           Update with meeting times and contact information

Helpful Information
•   Basic Tutorial
    o [Learn the Basics · React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial)
•   All Basic information (This shows you basically everything about React Native and provides tools to help you)
    o [Introduction · React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
•   This shows you more information about the APIs that are part of React Native. One in particular that can be incredibly useful is Linking as it is used a lot throughout this app
    o [AccessibilityInfo · React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo)
•   This links to React Navigation, which is used throughout the app and allows for the buttons to work and bring you to place
    o [Getting started | React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/)
•   For all the buttons they use touchable opacity so this gives you a guide on how it works
    o [TouchableOpacity · React Native](https://s-pace.github.io/react-native/docs/touchableopacity.html)
•   Android Studio works well for developing this project as you can view the app to the side while typing the code.
•   Code conversion shouldn’t be to hard from Android to iOS as it is relatively the same. 
    o   Xcode is a recommended replacement
